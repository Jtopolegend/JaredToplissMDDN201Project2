	<h1> Project Idea</h1>
	<p>The main goal of this project is to make Public transport in Wellington easier and less confusing for passengers both new and existing
     which is the main goal of this intervention to make things less complicated then they need to be which will not only help public transport
     but Wellingtonians as a whole due to the changes with the entire system not so long ago. The issue I looked into for the idea of this  project
		 was the Confusion amongst people regarding the physical and digital services of Metlink as I wondered if they were linked together due to
		 witnessing and observing other people asking other passengers or bus drivers questions regarding transport such as where busses and trains
		 goes and what zones they are a part of as to do with the changes with the zones last year which was a total mess and failure.
		 I also looked into How this relates to information on the app or website being slow and unreliable.
		 <br>
		 <h1> Project Proposal </h1>
		 <p> Through this project I propose that I want to try and build my own website for Wellington Transport services that is simple and easy
			   to use yet also very clean and organized for the users to find important information such as bus and train timetables updates delays,
				 and cancellations easily and not be confused at all while doing so. I also want to make it as user friendly to as much plinks for ideas behind my purpose for this design project/interventioneople as I can
				 so that it is more accessible for both regularâ€™s users and inexperienced newcomers or tourists visiting Wellington to prevent and stop
				 confusion and frustration amongst them. </p>
