    <h1>Wireframes</h1>
    <p> These wireframes helped me to develop the start of my website of gaining an idea of what I want to have on my main two pages and how I want to
         lay it all out for my WTPS site with having an engaging interactive homepage with images users can view through a slideshow and then navigate
         to the project page to find out more about what I aim to accomplish with this project intervention to improve Wellingtons public transport services
         as a whole for Passengers both new and already existing. </p>

  <h1> Logo </h1>
  <p> The purpose and main idea of this logo is to have a symbol that passengers can be familiar with as it is reminiscent of Metlinks with the train and the words of
      a public transport services that can be easily identifiable on my website of what exactly it is and also on other merchandising for this project as something to
      associate WPTS with.</p>

  <h1> Colour Scheme Wireframes </h1>
  <p> The Golden yellow and black help identify my website scheme with Wellington colours as it also will blend well
       with wellington which is successful and creates a sense of pattern that is consistent throughout this project linking to the logo
       as its focus is on the improvement of Wellington Public Transport services which is the purpose of this project.
       This colour scheme will help the users to associate and identify this as something that is apart of wellington. </p>
